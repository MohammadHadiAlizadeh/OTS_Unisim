A simple, minimal replica of an OTS for a single compressor with very limited features. It connects to a UniSim dynamic simulation using COM automation (win32com lib in Python) and provides a simple GUI (TKinter based) to start and stop the simulation, continuously monitor the inlet and outlet pressures over simulation time, and display real-time plot.
